# Atomic Design System

This document describes the structure of the `src/lib/components` folder for creating new Components

## Overview

Welcome to our Atomic Design System! This system is built on the principles of Atomic Design, which organizes user interfaces into discrete levels of complexityâ€”Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, and beyond.

## Structure

### Tokens

Tokens are the foundational building blocks of our design system. They encompass variables like colors, typography, spacing, and other design properties. They serve as the consistent values that define the visual language of our application.

### Elements

Elements are the next level of abstraction. They combine tokens to form basic UI components with minimal functionality. Examples include buttons, form inputs, and icons. Elements encapsulate the fundamental visual and interactive aspects of our design language.

### Components

Components are more complex than Elements, often combining multiple Elements and Tokens to create reusable, functional units. Examples include navigation bars, cards, and modals. Components are the building blocks for constructing entire pages or views within our application.
